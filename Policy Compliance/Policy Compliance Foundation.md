# Policy Compliance Foundation

## Introduction
IT Policy Compliance is the implementation and management of information technology under accepted standards. This includes how it is obtained and stored, secured, its availability, and how the data is protected. 

The applicability of these standards for your organization depends on various factors. They can include:                   
- The nature of your business
- The types of data processed by your organization
- The risks that apply to your environment    

## Categories of IT compilance
Specialized tools are used to continuously identify, monitor, report, and audit the use of information technology. This helps to achieve and remain in compliance.

### Internal Compliance
The internal compliance functions revolve around:
- Policies
- Goals
- Organizational structure of the business

### External Compliance
External considerations include satisfying the customer or end-user while protecting the company and end-user from harm. They revolve around:
- Industry regulations
- Government policies
- Security frameworks
- Client or customer contractual terms

## Laws, policies and Standards
- An important aspect of Policy Compliance is proving that Information Technology operates in conformance with laws and regulations.
- Most IT compliance requirements start at the top, with laws and regulations in their current state. These articulate the 'policies' and 'standards' governing their needs.
- Policies and standards, in turn, have operating requirements for compliance that are pushed down on each organization. Auditors enforce these compliances. 

### Policies
A policy is a high-level document usually governed by the management. Further, it results in standards that later form procedures. A policy is the foundation of all the required documentation.

### Best Practice 1: Remember the Big Picture
There are two important aspects to look for to understand the big picture.

1. Maintain your perspective
- Identify what you are trying to protect or control
- Understand your organization's policy control objectives

Companies often focus only on controls for data security. However, they should also take into consideration other vital areas such as:
- Administrative controls: The policies, procedures, and processes associated with the control objectives.
- Physical and environmental controls: The physical protection of electronic and non-electronic information or assets. Examples are door locks, camera monitoring, and fire suppression.
- Logical controls: A control of access to specific networks and resources by an authorized user; generally managed by information technology.
  
2. Auditor's Mentality
- Beware of Auditor's objective, approach, and plan
- Understand the different risks that the Auditor will evaluate

An auditor’s role is to decide whether or not your organization’s policy controls are working and if they were correctly designed before deployment. An auditor plans activities by evaluating audit risk. Audit risk is the risk that an auditor has incorrectly issued on a set of financial statements or a controlled environment. Audit risk is defined as follows: 

Audit risk = Inherent risk × Control risk × Detection risk

- Inherent risk: things built into the audit situation that the auditor doesn’t control, such as type of business, activity, or other environmental factors. 
- Control risk: the likelihood that the control environment won’t detect or prevent an error or misstatement. When the client designs a better control environment, it automatically reduces control and audit risks. 
- Detection risk: the likelihood that an auditor’s testing won’t capture an error or misstatement. This audit risk area is over which an auditor has the most control.

Few essential things that should be taken note:
1. An auditor’s objective is to minimize overall audit risk. If inherent risk and deficiency are present within the control environment, the auditor compensates by reducing detection risk. As a result, the auditor does more testing and uses larger sample sizes. 
2. Auditor uses a sampling methodology as they cannot check every IT control of every asset. A sampling methodology limits the checking to an acceptable scope by specifying the number of systems, transactions, etc., to be tested to obtain a reasonable determination of whether your controls are meeting your policy objectives.
3. The types of controls you implement also affect the type of testing. For instance, if you configure your servers manually and audit them manually, the auditor will do so. Likewise, suppose you use automated configuration management software and compliance monitoring technology (such as Vulnerability Management). In that case, the auditor's testing will focus more on the configuration of the technology, plus a light manual review to ensure that the technology is working correctly.
