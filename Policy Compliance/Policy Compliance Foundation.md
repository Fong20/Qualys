# Policy Compliance Foundation

## Introduction
IT Policy Compliance is the implementation and management of information technology under accepted standards. This includes how it is obtained and stored, secured, its availability, and how the data is protected. 

The applicability of these standards for your organization depends on various factors. They can include:                   
- The nature of your business
- The types of data processed by your organization
- The risks that apply to your environment    

## Categories of IT compilance
Specialized tools are used to continuously identify, monitor, report, and audit the use of information technology. This helps to achieve and remain in compliance.

### Internal Compliance
The internal compliance functions revolve around:
- Policies
- Goals
- Organizational structure of the business

### External Compliance
External considerations include satisfying the customer or end-user while protecting the company and end-user from harm. They revolve around:
- Industry regulations
- Government policies
- Security frameworks
- Client or customer contractual terms

## Laws, policies and Standards
- An important aspect of Policy Compliance is proving that Information Technology operates in conformance with laws and regulations.
- Most IT compliance requirements start at the top, with laws and regulations in their current state. These articulate the 'policies' and 'standards' governing their needs.
- Policies and standards, in turn, have operating requirements for compliance that are pushed down on each organization. Auditors enforce these compliances. 

### Policies
A policy is a high-level document usually governed by the management. Further, it results in standards that later form procedures. A policy is the foundation of all the required documentation.

## IT Policy Compliance Best Practices

### Best Practice 1: Remember the Big Picture
There are two important aspects to look for to understand the big picture.

1. Maintain your perspective
- Identify what you are trying to protect or control
- Understand your organization's policy control objectives

Companies often focus only on controls for data security. However, they should also take into consideration other vital areas such as:
- Administrative controls: The policies, procedures, and processes associated with the control objectives.
- Physical and environmental controls: The physical protection of electronic and non-electronic information or assets. Examples are door locks, camera monitoring, and fire suppression.
- Logical controls: A control of access to specific networks and resources by an authorized user; generally managed by information technology.
  
2. Auditor's Mentality
- Beware of Auditor's objective, approach, and plan
- Understand the different risks that the Auditor will evaluate

An auditor’s role is to decide whether or not your organization’s policy controls are working and if they were correctly designed before deployment. An auditor plans activities by evaluating audit risk. Audit risk is the risk that an auditor has incorrectly issued on a set of financial statements or a controlled environment. Audit risk is defined as follows: 

Audit risk = Inherent risk × Control risk × Detection risk

- Inherent risk: things built into the audit situation that the auditor doesn’t control, such as type of business, activity, or other environmental factors. 
- Control risk: the likelihood that the control environment won’t detect or prevent an error or misstatement. When the client designs a better control environment, it automatically reduces control and audit risks. 
- Detection risk: the likelihood that an auditor’s testing won’t capture an error or misstatement. This audit risk area is over which an auditor has the most control.

Few essential things that should be taken note:
1. An auditor’s objective is to minimize overall audit risk. If inherent risk and deficiency are present within the control environment, the auditor compensates by reducing detection risk. As a result, the auditor does more testing and uses larger sample sizes. 
2. Auditor uses a sampling methodology as they cannot check every IT control of every asset. A sampling methodology limits the checking to an acceptable scope by specifying the number of systems, transactions, etc., to be tested to obtain a reasonable determination of whether your controls are meeting your policy objectives.
3. The types of controls you implement also affect the type of testing. For instance, if you configure your servers manually and audit them manually, the auditor will do so. Likewise, suppose you use automated configuration management software and compliance monitoring technology (such as Vulnerability Management). In that case, the auditor's testing will focus more on the configuration of the technology, plus a light manual review to ensure that the technology is working correctly. 

### Best Practice 2: Align IT Policy Compliance and Security with the Business
Real business and compliance alignment start with understanding the culture of your organization. Many models have been created to devise and articulate organizational capabilities and maturity. By using these models, we can identify and align the IT Policy compliance with the businesses.

**Model 1: Compliance Maturity Spectrum**
**Levels of different levels.**
- Level 1: Minimal
- Level 2: Reactive
- Level 3: Evolving
- Level 4: Continuously Compliant
- Level 5: Strategic

The most important aspect is the belief about compliance in an organization. Is compliance merely a process to be ticked and done with, or is it a practice that your organization believes in, an approach that makes a profound impact on the organization at large?Once the business believe in compliance, it can invest in each of the components of the belief system:

**Components of the belief system:**
- The People
- The Process
- The Technology

**Model 2: The SEI Common Maturity Model**

A lot of thought and years of research bring in this model. At one end of the model, we have organizations labeled as or referred to as Initial or Ad-hoc, while on the other end, we have organizations labeled as Dynamic or Optimized. 

Approximately 40 percent of organizations fall into the 'Initial' or 'Ad-hoc' classification. These organizations will typically have to design more preventive and detective controls for policy compliance. Simply issuing a policy and hoping that it will be followed will fail. Organizations in this category may not require in-depth policies, but detailed standards for configuration and implementation with technology controls will keep them aligned and in compliance.

**Identifying Business Risk**

After we have determined what level of control aligns with the organization’s culture, the next step is to address the business risk. A business-based approach also maximizes the value of the security data collected. These data can help identify waste, increase the quality of IT services, and promote efficiency and visibility into the business.

For policy compliance, the focus of reporting must be the business process layer or the specific business risk you’re trying to assess. Here are some examples: 

1. Privacy audits- for personally identifiable information.
2. Audits- for protection of intellectual property in research and development.
3.Operational reviews of controls for critical lines of business, such as e-commerce. The PCI Data Security Standard, for instance, puts the focus of an assessment on a particular segment of business operations as opposed to the overall enterprise.

### Best Practice 3: Understand Your Technology Environment
The technology environment, like culture, directly impacts the design and effectiveness of the IT Policy Compliance program. Thus, it is very important to identify the environment.

**Identifying Your Environment**

The technology environment can be categorized into homogeneous and heterogeneous environment categories.

**Homogenous environment**

**In a homogeneous environment, the technical environment is largely consistent.** Here, you can see names such as Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, or Dell for nearly all desktops, laptops, and servers. Networking equipment could be from Cisco Systems, Inc., and while deviations may exist, they are rare. 

**Some organizations that have many locations may standardize on a consistent deployment.** This enables each location to have a duplicate technical environment, such as branch locations for banks or store locations for retail environments. 

**Heterogeneous environment**

**Heterogeneous environments use various technologies, versions, and compliance and security applications.** The heterogeneity of the technical infrastructure often grows more complex over time, especially in large organizations. **New acquisitions, mergers, and changes in IT leadership and direction are typical reasons a technical environment can become more diverse and complex over time.** 

Each technology platform must have a hardening policy describing compliance and security that must be secured. This should also include a description of mitigating procedures on how that system will protect critical information assets. 

**Virtualization**

Virtualization has many ‘logical’ systems residing on a few physical ones. The use of virtualization has added additional complexity to compliance and security initiatives. This is because in each physical system, such as a Windows desktop with a virtualization software installed, the physical device may be hosting multiple ‘logical’ systems. These virtual systems might share the physical system’s unique IP address, or each virtual ‘instance’ may have its IP address on the corporate network. As a result, there are many potential permutations which pose a considerable challenge for IT compliance.

Thus, if the organization uses virtualization, the policies must cover acceptable use of the technology, and authorized users should be well documented. The policies must include virtualization management systems and management of virtual images.
