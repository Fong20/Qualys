# Policy Compliance Foundation

## Introduction
IT Policy Compliance is the implementation and management of information technology under accepted standards. This includes how it is obtained and stored, secured, its availability, and how the data is protected. 

The applicability of these standards for your organization depends on various factors. They can include:                   
- The nature of your business
- The types of data processed by your organization
- The risks that apply to your environment    

## Categories of IT compilance
Specialized tools are used to continuously identify, monitor, report, and audit the use of information technology. This helps to achieve and remain in compliance.

### Internal Compliance
The internal compliance functions revolve around:
- Policies
- Goals
- Organizational structure of the business

### External Compliance
External considerations include satisfying the customer or end-user while protecting the company and end-user from harm. They revolve around:
- Industry regulations
- Government policies
- Security frameworks
- Client or customer contractual terms

## Laws, policies and Standards
- An important aspect of Policy Compliance is proving that Information Technology operates in conformance with laws and regulations.
- Most IT compliance requirements start at the top, with laws and regulations in their current state. These articulate the 'policies' and 'standards' governing their needs.
- Policies and standards, in turn, have operating requirements for compliance that are pushed down on each organization. Auditors enforce these compliances.
- You can’t begin the process of policy compliance without knowing which laws and regulations are applicable to your company.

### Policies
A policy is a high-level document usually governed by the management. Further, it results in standards that later form procedures. A policy is the foundation of all the required documentation.

## IT Policy Compliance Best Practices

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bdc54c1-0153-445a-bf65-d4772b5d5ad6)

### Best Practice 1: Remember the Big Picture
There are two important aspects to look for to understand the big picture.

1. Maintain your perspective
- Identify what you are trying to protect or control
- Understand your organization's policy control objectives

Companies often focus only on controls for data security. However, they should also take into consideration other vital areas such as:
- Administrative controls: The policies, procedures, and processes associated with the control objectives.
- Physical and environmental controls: The physical protection of electronic and non-electronic information or assets. Examples are door locks, camera monitoring, and fire suppression.
- Logical controls: A control of access to specific networks and resources by an authorized user; generally managed by information technology.
  
2. Auditor's Mentality
- Beware of Auditor's objective, approach, and plan
- Understand the different risks that the Auditor will evaluate

An auditor’s role is to decide whether or not your organization’s policy controls are working and if they were correctly designed before deployment. An auditor plans activities by evaluating audit risk. Audit risk is the risk that an auditor has incorrectly issued on a set of financial statements or a controlled environment. Audit risk is defined as follows: 

Audit risk = Inherent risk × Control risk × Detection risk

- Inherent risk: things built into the audit situation that the auditor doesn’t control, such as type of business, activity, or other environmental factors. 
- Control risk: the likelihood that the control environment won’t detect or prevent an error or misstatement. When the client designs a better control environment, it automatically reduces control and audit risks. 
- Detection risk: the likelihood that an auditor’s testing won’t capture an error or misstatement. This audit risk area is over which an auditor has the most control.

Few essential things that should be taken note:
1. An auditor’s objective is to minimize overall audit risk. If inherent risk and deficiency are present within the control environment, the auditor compensates by reducing detection risk. As a result, the auditor does more testing and uses larger sample sizes. 
2. Auditor uses a sampling methodology as they cannot check every IT control of every asset. A sampling methodology limits the checking to an acceptable scope by specifying the number of systems, transactions, etc., to be tested to obtain a reasonable determination of whether your controls are meeting your policy objectives.
3. The types of controls you implement also affect the type of testing. For instance, if you configure your servers manually and audit them manually, the auditor will do so. Likewise, suppose you use automated configuration management software and compliance monitoring technology (such as Vulnerability Management). In that case, the auditor's testing will focus more on the configuration of the technology, plus a light manual review to ensure that the technology is working correctly. 

### Best Practice 2: Align IT Policy Compliance and Security with the Business
Real business and compliance alignment start with understanding the culture of your organization. Many models have been created to devise and articulate organizational capabilities and maturity. By using these models, we can identify and align the IT Policy compliance with the businesses.

**Model 1: Compliance Maturity Spectrum**
**Levels of different levels.**
- Level 1: Minimal
- Level 2: Reactive
- Level 3: Evolving
- Level 4: Continuously Compliant
- Level 5: Strategic

The most important aspect is the belief about compliance in an organization. Is compliance merely a process to be ticked and done with, or is it a practice that your organization believes in, an approach that makes a profound impact on the organization at large?Once the business believe in compliance, it can invest in each of the components of the belief system:

**Components of the belief system:**
- The People
- The Process
- The Technology

**Model 2: The SEI Common Maturity Model**

A lot of thought and years of research bring in this model. At one end of the model, we have organizations labeled as or referred to as Initial or Ad-hoc, while on the other end, we have organizations labeled as Dynamic or Optimized. 

Approximately 40 percent of organizations fall into the 'Initial' or 'Ad-hoc' classification. These organizations will typically have to design more preventive and detective controls for policy compliance. Simply issuing a policy and hoping that it will be followed will fail. Organizations in this category may not require in-depth policies, but detailed standards for configuration and implementation with technology controls will keep them aligned and in compliance.

**Identifying Business Risk**

After we have determined what level of control aligns with the organization’s culture, the next step is to address the business risk. A business-based approach also maximizes the value of the security data collected. These data can help identify waste, increase the quality of IT services, and promote efficiency and visibility into the business.

For policy compliance, the focus of reporting must be the business process layer or the specific business risk you’re trying to assess. Here are some examples: 

1. Privacy audits- for personally identifiable information.
2. Audits- for protection of intellectual property in research and development.
3.Operational reviews of controls for critical lines of business, such as e-commerce. The PCI Data Security Standard, for instance, puts the focus of an assessment on a particular segment of business operations as opposed to the overall enterprise.

### Best Practice 3: Understand Your Technology Environment
The technology environment, like culture, directly impacts the design and effectiveness of the IT Policy Compliance program. Thus, it is very important to identify the environment.

**Identifying Your Environment**

The technology environment can be categorized into homogeneous and heterogeneous environment categories.

**Homogenous environment**

**In a homogeneous environment, the technical environment is largely consistent.** Here, you can see names such as Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, or Dell for nearly all desktops, laptops, and servers. Networking equipment could be from Cisco Systems, Inc., and while deviations may exist, they are rare. 

**Some organizations that have many locations may standardize on a consistent deployment.** This enables each location to have a duplicate technical environment, such as branch locations for banks or store locations for retail environments. 

**Heterogeneous environment**

**Heterogeneous environments use various technologies, versions, and compliance and security applications.** The heterogeneity of the technical infrastructure often grows more complex over time, especially in large organizations. **New acquisitions, mergers, and changes in IT leadership and direction are typical reasons a technical environment can become more diverse and complex over time.** 

Each technology platform must have a hardening policy describing compliance and security that must be secured. This should also include a description of mitigating procedures on how that system will protect critical information assets. 

**Virtualization**

Virtualization has many ‘logical’ systems residing on a few physical ones. The use of virtualization has added additional complexity to compliance and security initiatives. This is because in each physical system, such as a Windows desktop with a virtualization software installed, the physical device may be hosting multiple ‘logical’ systems. These virtual systems might share the physical system’s unique IP address, or each virtual ‘instance’ may have its IP address on the corporate network. As a result, there are many potential permutations which pose a considerable challenge for IT compliance.

Thus, if the organization uses virtualization, the policies must cover acceptable use of the technology, and authorized users should be well documented. The policies must include virtualization management systems and management of virtual images.

### Best Practice 4: IT Compliance Starts with Policy
- Policies define the ‘who’ and ‘what’ elements of compliance. Procedures and standards define the ‘how.’
- Policy creation requires interviews with the business stakeholders to identify which controls are applicable, which are not, and what weighting should be assigned to controls and assets for prioritization and result measurement. 

### Best practice 5: Establish Accountability
Defining roles and responsibilities of IT security compliance to maintain accountability is essential. Compliance programs don’t work without accountability. Maintaining accountability involves defining roles and responsibilities in the organization that define what assets an individual is responsible for protecting and who has authority to make decisions. 

**Defining roles and responsibilities**

To maintain accountability of policies, processes, and standards, it is necessary to correctly define the roles and responsibilities. Once they are defined, the top management and stakeholders should finalize the owners and grant them privileges accordingly.

1. Data Owner
- This person is a member of the management team within the organization who is responsible for how data and systems are used and for their ultimate care.
- This owner could be the CEO or General Manager of a particular line of business.
- The data or system owner is accountable for managing and protecting its information.

2. Data custodian
- This person is in charge of maintaining and protecting data through traditional operational processes and is usually staffed in IT operations or security.
- Backing up data, maintaining logs, and restoring data are examples of responsibilities for this role.
- The data or system custodian doesn’t decide how the data is stored or protected but is responsible for executing decisions made by the data owner.

### Best practice 6: Conduct a Pre-Audit or Readiness Assessment
- By engaging with the auditor before an audit, IT policy design issues become visible, and gaps in coverage are identified before the official audit occurs. This extra step increases the cost of an audit program. However, it demonstrates a commitment to compliance.
- Pre-audit consultants can then share best practices and show how to adjust focus areas for a better balance of resources.

**Typical items tested in a pre-audit or readiness assessment:**
1. A policy and procedure review.
2. An organizational review.
3. A high-level controls architecture review.
4. A review of previous audit reports.
5. A comparison of a sample group of regular and administrative users’ access levels to what is necessary.
6. A review of standard build documents.
7. A comparison of a sample of systems with secure build documents.
8. A review of change management procedures and selection of a sample of change tickets to review and see if procedures were followed.
9. A review of incident-handling procedures and selection of a sample of tickets to review and see if procedures were followed.
10. A physical and environmental control walk-through.

### Best practice 7: Centralize IT Policy Program Management
Multiple scenarios such as a large company which runs multiple businesses under one name and the expansion of business in various regions can cause the cost of compliance for an enterprise to increase exponentially. Thus, it is important to centralize the IT policy across the whole organizations.

**Important tips in centralizing IT policy program**
1. Select a common risk model and a set of standards for the organization.
2. Normalize reporting so that values are consistent across regions and lines of business.
3. Leverage a common set of industry standards such as CIS, AusCERT, ISO, or SANS.
4. Validate that policies created by regional teams are accurate and applicable enterprise-wide.

### Best practice 8: Prioritize Remediation Activities
Remediation, the process of fixing deficiencies is a critical activity. It needs to be planned and executed in a logical, repeatable, and defendable manner to auditors. Aim to associate the prioritization value of an asset by both its physical cost and its role in accomplishing a business goal. In this manner, your compliance program can better ensure that you address the most critical deficiencies and exposures that could impact the business first. 

**Rules of thumb for prioritizing remediation activities:**
1. Business critical risks and exposures
Remediation should leverage a risk-oriented approach based on a solid understanding of the business process and the technical environment. Technical resources mus be maximized for securing information assets and improving the business.

2. Usage of previous audit findings
Repeat audit findings are one of the top reasons compliance managers are found negligent and a prime reason a compliance manager can be relieved of a job. For this reason, reviewing the findings of each audit after that audit has taken place is essential. Addressing discovered lapses, policy violations, and other areas of negligence before the next audit is imperative. Prioritize problem areas for remediation or document them as accepted risks to justify deviation from policy. When IT auditors arrive onsite, one of the first things they ask for is previous audit documentation.

3. Address multiple control weaknesses
In many cases, a single technical configuration process or a utility can help to remediate multiple issues at once. Part of prioritizing remediation is identifying where you get the most ‘bang for your buck.’ Weighing criticality of the issue is involved, but if a single hour’s worth of work can remediate hundreds of problems, a good practice is to do it right away.

4. Go after the low-hanging fruit
In prioritizing remediation tasks, a standard best practice is to go after the ‘low-hanging fruit’ – in other words, identify what you can do quickly with the most significant impact to get the momentum rolling in the program.

**Examples:**
- Disabling common prohibited network services like telnet, FTP, TFTP, chargen, and so on
- Confirming file permissions for common critical files are set as expected
- Restricting software, such as peer-to-peer networking applications, that isn’t pertinent to the business
- Confirming that only authorized individuals have administrator access and require individual account usage where possible for tracking purposes
- Disabling accounts that haven’t been used for a predetermined period
- Enforcing a minimum password complexity level and audit policies on all systems
- On Windows platforms, leveraging group policies to confirm security settings are effectively implemented
- Leveraging security utilities where possible; security tools like TCP_Wrappers and Sudo can significantly help with common compliance issues

Note: Remediating all deficiencies at once is realistically impossible. It would be best to document why you didn’t close a particular finding. Many organizations have exceptions for items that aren’t addressed. If you show your auditor why the risk was low and why you chose to focus on more critical deficiencies, your position is more defensible, should it be challenged in the next audit. 

### Best practice 9: Understand How IT Policy Compliance Management Can Help in Other Areas
Most IT security staff view IT compliance as an extension of IT security. Surveying the compliance technology landscape confirms this perspective. Implementing the right IT policy compliance controls can also help you in related areas, such as vulnerability and change in management. 

**Importance of IT Policy Compliance Reporting**
- IT Policy Compliance reporting can benefit many areas of an organization’s management. For example, IT organizations can use much of the same compliance reporting to identify performance and availability issues to increase the quality of service to internal customers. Many IT operations teams also benefit from automated compliance and security tools to enumerate systems in their environment for categorization.
- IT Policy Compliance reporting can also identify abuses of authority and confirm that system configuration is consistent across the enterprise. Aligning IT security and compliance with the business are further enabled through consistent data processes and reporting.

### Best practice 10: Regularly Monitor the Whole Compliance Program
Compliance environment is an ecosystem that includes many different components, where some are IT-related and some not. However, all the solutions, must fit into an overall policy compliance program. It is also crucial that a sanity check of the overall policy compliance program is done at least annually and not just when the auditors visit. Lastly, never forget that the controls must be risk-based, and they must make financial sense. 

**Key aspects to check annually concerning your policy compliance program:**
1. Is the overall set of compliance policies being followed?
2. Are all of the controls (physical, administrative, and technical) aligned such that you have a comprehensive view of where you stand?
3. Are the overall reporting capabilities of point solutions combined for executive-level reporting?
4. Are data custodians (in other words, IT administrators) able to take the outputs from audits and point solutions and remediate negative control findings?
5. Overall, do the combined set of policies, procedures, and technologies drive the appropriate level of accountability across the organization?

## Automation in IT Policy Compliance

### Need for Automation
Automation is required for IT policy compliance when: 

1. An organization is expanding across the globe at an incredible speed. The IT resources continue to grow, and the use of cloud-based services has increased.
2. Auditors cannot evaluate a good number of assets regularly.
3. It is becoming very taxing to maintain the database of all the policies, related procedures, and government standards and how they impact an organization.
4. With the increase in the number of assets, human errors while auditing is increasing.

### Benefits of Automation
1. Monitor a more extensive range of transactions, controls, and systems than a person could ever assess using a manual process.
2. Provide a level of consistency that eliminates the subjectivity of human review.
3. Run metrics and reports that ultimately help you manage the quality of both your compliance program and operations overall.

### Criterias to consider before the implementation of Automation
When considering automation, an organization should consider these questions:

1. What control checks are we trying to automate?
2. How do we plan to capture the data?
3. What changes must we make to our systems to implement the technology?
4. What reports do we need to be available internally and externally?

Once an answer is found for these criterias, the next important factor is finding the appropriate solution or application that can take care of all your needs.
